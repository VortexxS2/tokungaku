## Technical Details

### Browser Compatibility

Tokungaku is built using modern web standards and should work in all modern browsers, including:

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### Dependencies

Tokungaku is built with vanilla JavaScript and doesn't require any external libraries or frameworks.

## Limitations

- MIDI export is currently implemented as a JSON representation. A proper MIDI export would require a MIDI library.
- Audio playback uses simple sine wave oscillators. More advanced sound synthesis would improve the audio quality.

## Future Improvements

- Implement proper MIDI export using a MIDI library
- Add more advanced sound synthesis options
- Support for multiple tracks/instruments
- Undo/redo functionality
- More keyboard shortcuts and usability improvements
