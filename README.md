## Using MIDI Export with DAWs

Tokungaku allows you to export your compositions as standard MIDI files that can be imported into any Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) such as Ableton Live, FL Studio, Logic Pro, GarageBand, or similar music production software.

### How to Export and Use MIDI Files:

1. Create your composition in Tokungaku
2. Select your preferred instrument (this will be exported as MIDI program information)
3. Click the "Export MIDI" button in the top bar
4. Save the .mid file to your computer
5. In your DAW software:
   - Import/Open the MIDI file (usually via File > Import or drag-and-drop)
   - The notes, tempo, and time signature will be preserved
   - Apply your DAW's high-quality instrument sounds and effects
   - Edit further if needed using your DAW's piano roll editor
   - Mix with other tracks and produce your final music

The exported MIDI contains all musical data but no actual audio samples, allowing you to use your DAW's professional sound libraries for the final production.

## Limitations

- Audio playback uses Web Audio API and may vary slightly between browsers.
- For best experience, use a desktop browser with a physical keyboard.
